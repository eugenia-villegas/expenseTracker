<h1>Expense Tracker</h1>

<p>Hi all, I've been working on this project for college and it was actually fun to do.</p>

<p>We are seeing an expense tracker made from mainly HTML, CSS and PHP, it is connected to a 
database so your login and sign up are completely functional and your expenses/incomes can 
only be made by you. I learned the basics of php and I already knew html, css and js.</p>

<p>If you want to make use of this code go ahead but remember to change your db.php settings for your own project</p>
